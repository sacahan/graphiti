# Task: Audit Neo4j hardcoded dependencies

## Description

Perform comprehensive code audit to identify all hardcoded Neo4j dependencies throughout the Graphiti codebase. This foundational task will map out exactly what needs to be refactored to enable database backend switching.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Complete inventory of hardcoded Neo4j references in `graphiti_core/`
- [ ] Document specific locations where database type assumptions are made
- [ ] Identify MCP server initialization code that assumes Neo4j
- [ ] List all configuration files that hardcode Neo4j settings
- [ ] Create refactoring plan with impact assessment for each component
- [ ] Document existing `BaseGraphDriver` interface capabilities and limitations

## Technical Details

### Implementation Approach

- Use `grep -r "neo4j" graphiti_core/` to identify obvious references
- Search for `Neo4j` class names and imports
- Review configuration initialization in main `Graphiti` class
- Analyze MCP server startup sequence in `mcp_server/`
- Check for hardcoded connection strings or database-specific logic

### Key Areas to Investigate

- `graphiti_core/graphiti.py` - Main orchestration class
- `graphiti_core/driver/` - Database driver implementations
- `mcp_server/` - MCP server initialization
- Configuration management and environment variable handling
- Test files that assume Neo4j backend

### Code Locations/Files Affected

- `graphiti_core/graphiti.py`
- `graphiti_core/driver/`
- `mcp_server/graphiti_mcp_server.py`
- Any configuration files in project root
- Example files in `examples/`

## Dependencies

- [ ] Access to full Graphiti codebase
- [ ] Understanding of current driver architecture
- [ ] Familiarity with both Neo4j and FalkorDB APIs

## Effort Estimate

- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 8-12 hours
- **Parallel**: true (independent analysis work)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Comprehensive audit document created with findings
- [ ] Refactoring plan with effort estimates per component
- [ ] Current `BaseGraphDriver` interface analysis completed
- [ ] No hardcoded dependencies missed in the inventory
- [ ] Impact assessment ready for implementation tasks
