# Issue #006 Progress: Extend integration tests for dual-database support

## Overview

Extending integration test suite to support both Neo4j and FalkorDB backends with comprehensive coverage.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure (Completed)

- [x] Analyze current test structure and patterns
- [x] Review existing dual-database setup in helpers_test.py
- [x] Parameterize integration tests for dual-database execution
- [x] Update test fixtures for consistent dual-database behavior

### Phase 2: Core Test Implementation (Completed)

- [x] Create comprehensive DriverFactory integration tests
- [x] Extend existing integration tests with database switching scenarios
- [x] Add error handling and edge case tests for database selection
- [x] Implement database-specific feature tests

### Phase 3: Performance and Benchmarking (Completed)

- [x] Create performance benchmark tests for both backends
- [x] Add startup time and memory usage comparison tests
- [x] Implement query latency benchmarks
- [x] Add performance regression detection

### Phase 4: FalkorDB-Specific Features (Completed)

- [x] Test Redis-based features specific to FalkorDB
- [x] Add FalkorDB configuration and connection tests
- [x] Test FalkorDB-specific performance characteristics

### Phase 5: CI Integration (Completed)

- [x] Update GitHub Actions workflow for dual-database testing
- [x] Add test coverage reporting for new code paths
- [x] Ensure parallel execution of database-specific tests

## Current Status

**COMPLETED**: All dual-database test infrastructure implemented and integrated

## Key Findings

1. Current test infrastructure already supports dual-database testing via GraphProvider enum
2. Integration tests previously skipped FalkorDB - now fixed to support both backends
3. CI pipeline enhanced with comprehensive dual-database testing
4. Performance benchmarking and regression detection in place

## Completed Work

1. **Fixed existing integration tests**: Removed FalkorDB skips and added proper error handling
2. **Created comprehensive DriverFactory integration tests**: Full coverage of database switching functionality
3. **Added performance benchmarking infrastructure**: Automated performance comparison between backends
4. **Implemented FalkorDB-specific tests**: Redis-based features and performance characteristics
5. **Enhanced CI pipeline**: Separate and comparative test jobs for both databases
6. **Added test coverage and validation**: Proper test markers and infrastructure validation

## Test Files Created

- `tests/driver/test_factory_integration.py` - DriverFactory integration tests
- `tests/performance/test_backend_benchmarks.py` - Performance benchmarking suite
- `tests/test_dual_database_integration.py` - Parameterized dual-database tests
- `tests/test_falkordb_specific_features.py` - FalkorDB-specific functionality tests
- `scripts/test_dual_database_setup.py` - Infrastructure validation script

## CI Enhancements

- Separate test jobs for Neo4j and FalkorDB
- Dual-database comparison tests
- Performance regression detection
- Comprehensive test markers and organization
